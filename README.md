# story-teller
Based on one sentence it creates unique dialog between two peoples.

1. Run streamlit app. [streamlit run app.py]
2. Type one sentence, main story clue.
3. Magic happens âœ¨


The app is running on Langchain and Eleven Labs. Each dialogue is unique and uses at least two separate voices, mainly a man and a woman. 
The dialogs might be useful for learning languages. You can change your language level and language in general within the prompt.

Eleven Labs uses a multilingual voice, so there is no need to change the code if you want to hear a different language than English.
